# Dynamic Programming

* Notice any overlapping subproblems.
* Decide what is the triviallly smallest input.
* Think recursively to use Memoization.
* Think iteratively to use Tabulation.
* Draw a strategy first.


### Memoization Recipe

1. Make it work
* Visualize the problem as tree.
* Implement the tree using recursion.
* Test it

2. Make it efficient
* Add a memo hashmap.
* add a base case to return memo values.
* store values into the memo


### Tabulation Recipe

* Visualize the problem as a table
* Size the table based on the input.
* Initialize the table with default values.
* Seed the trivial answer into the table.
* Iterate through the table
* Fill further conditions based on the current position
