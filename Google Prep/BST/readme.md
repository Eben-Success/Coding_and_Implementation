A binary search tree, or BST is a binary tree whose node values are guaranteed to stay in sorted order; that is in order traversal of its node will create a sorted list.

Insertion, lookup and deletion operations run in O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree.

If efficient implementation is used to maintain the height of the tree around O(logn), where n is the number of nodes, then these operations will be logarithmic in n.
